#### Lecture 1 : Affordances

##### Find and documents (Video/Picture) one bad and one good affordance in your daily life.. Explain why they are good or bad and suggest how you could fix the bad ones.

**Good affordance**

An example of good affordance is the MacBook charger. Here are some key points that showcase how efficient this affordance is. 

- **Reversible connector** : It can be plugged in on either side. Users can easily plug it in without worrying about the orientation of the connector. This reduces frustration and ensures a smooth user experience.

- **Indicator light** : It has the particularity of having a light that turns orange when it's plugged in and turns green when it is charging. Changing from orange to green serves as a clear and intuitive feedback mechanism. This visual cue helps users quickly understand the charging status without having to interact directly with the device.

- **User efficiency** : By providing a visual indicator on the charger itself, the design enhances user efficiency. Users can check the status at a glance, saving them the effort of opening the laptop, unlocking it, and searching for a charging icon.

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**:
The visual feedback through the changing colors reduces the cognitive load on the user. They don't need to remember specific color codes. Instead, the system uses familiar concepts (orange for charging, green for charged) that are easily understood.

- **Accessibility**:
The clear visual feedback is beneficial not only for users with no visibility issues but also for users with visual impairments. This type of feedback enhances the accessibility of the product.

**Bad affordance**

One situation all drivers have already encountered is the struggle to find on which side their petrol gas is located and how to orient their car at the gas station.

Here are some suggestions to fix this issue : 


Absolutely, this is a common situation that many drivers can relate to. To address this challenge, some car manufacturers have implemented a simple and effective solution: a small arrow next to the fuel gauge on the dashboard.

- **Fuel Gauge Indicator**:
Putting on the fuel gauge on the dashboard, a small arrow pointing to the side of the car where the fuel cap is located. Many car manufacturers have adopted this standardized design.This arrow is often accompanied by a fuel pump icon. This design choice is intuitive and user-friendly. Drivers can quickly glance at the dashboard to determine which side of the car the fuel cap is on without needing to get out of the vehicle. The presence of the arrow helps to reduce confusion, especially for drivers who may be using a rental car or borrowing a vehicle. It simplifies the refueling process and contributes to a positive user experience.
In addition, the use of a universally recognized symbol (fuel pump) and a directional arrow adds to the simplicity of the design. Drivers from different regions or with varying language proficiencies can easily understand the information. This feature is particularly helpful for new drivers who may not yet be familiar with the specific details of their vehicle. It promotes a smooth and stress-free experience at the gas station.
- **3D representation of the car**: Before switching off the car, allow it to display a representation of the car highlighting the fuel cap and indicating where the pump is located. It will indicate whether the driver is in the right direction and could also help determine if they are not too far from the pump.
