The aim of the project is to compute a **roll a ball** game. The idea is to roll a ball within a box in order to collect items. To win the game, the player must collect all the items. 

To complete the project, I followed the 
[learn.unity tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball).

Some of the issues I encountered : 

- Syntax error in my C# script : **inputeValue** instead of **InputValue**
- There was a rotation when I was moving the ball with my keyboard. To fix it : freeze rotation in x, y, z for the oject **ball** 

Here is a demo of the game :
