* 2014 : ACM UIST Lasting Impact Award. 

#### Career 

His research career has contributed to both fundamental models and understandings of human-computer interaction and practical user interface designs, inventions and mass-products. 

* From 2001 to 2007, Dr. Zhai was a visiting adjunct professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science (IDA) at Link√∂ping University, where he also supervised graduate research.
* 2004 : Released the first word-gesture keyboard in through IBM Alphaworks
* 2007 at IBM Almaden Research Center : riginated and led the **SHARK/ShapeWriter** project and a **start-up company** that pioneered the touchscreen swiping-gesture keyboard paradigm, filing the first patents of this paradigm, publishing the first generation of scientific papers and dissertations of the field.
* 2008 : Top ranked (6th) iPhone app **ShapeWriter WritingPad** 
* His publications have won the ACM UIST Lasting Impact Award and a IEEE Computer Society Best Paper Award, among others. 
* He served as the 4th Editor-in-Chief of ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, and frequently contributes to other academic boards and program committees. 
* 2009 to 2015:  editor-in-chief of the ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction and involved in both the conference side and the journal side of publishing HCI research as an author, reviewer, editor, committee member, and papers chair.
* 2011 till present: 
    * Working at Google as a Principal Scientist
    * Lead research and design of Google's keyboard products, Pixel phone haptics, and novel Google Assistant invocation methods.
    * Design of Active Edge, a headline feature of Google Pixel 2, which enables the user to reach Google Assistant faster and more intuitively using a gentle device squeeze rather than the touch screen.

#### Gesture Keyboard: Transforming Text Input
One of Dr. Zhai's most significant contributions to HCI lies in the development of the "Gesture Keyboard." In a world increasingly dominated by touchscreen devices, the need for efficient and user-friendly text input methods is paramount. Dr. Zhai's Gesture Keyboard represents a paradigm shift in how users interact with virtual keyboards.

This groundbreaking technology allows users to input text by making gestures on a touch-sensitive surface. By leveraging the natural motion of fingers and hands, Dr. Zhai's Gesture Keyboard offers an intuitive alternative to traditional keyboard input methods. This project has profound implications for mobile devices, tablets, and other touchscreen interfaces, enhancing the overall user experience.
