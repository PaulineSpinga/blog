**Dark design patterns or Deceptive patterns are tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to, like buying or signing up for something.**

#### First example : pop-up window and cookies üç™

Pop-up windows that appear and force you to accept all cookies can be frustrating. To choose the cookies you authorize or reject, you often have to search for the 'manage settings' text, which is typically hidden among other text in the pop-up that you might not read. To save time, we generally accept them even if we don't consent. One example I often encounter is the[Marmiton](https://www.marmiton.org) website, known for its recipes. The pop-up window appears as soon as you enter the website. Then you have 3 options : 
* Accept üç™
* Decline üç™
* Manage üç™  

The situation is, if you dare to decline or if you choose none of them in the "Manage" section, you are asked whether to accept or to subscribe.

Here are some tips to achieve the opposite. 

- **Clear and Visible Options**:
Ensure that the options to manage cookie settings, such as 'manage settings' or 'cookie preferences,' are prominently displayed. Make them easily visible so users can find them without much effort.

- **Direct Language**: Use straightforward and direct language in the pop-up. Clearly communicate that users have the option to manage cookie settings and provide a link or button that leads directly to those settings.

- **Explanatory Text**:
Include a brief, clear explanation about why cookies are used and the impact of accepting or rejecting them. This helps users understand the purpose and make informed decisions.

- **Prioritize User Control**:
Provide granular control over cookie preferences. Allow users to easily select which types of cookies they want to accept or reject. This enhances user control and promotes trust.

- **Minimize Clutter**:
Simplify the design of the pop-up. Remove unnecessary text and visuals that can contribute to clutter and confusion. Focus on the essential information and options.

- **Delayed Appearance**:
Delay the appearance of the pop-up until users have had the chance to engage with the content. This reduces the likelihood of users feeling interrupted upon entering the site.
Remember User Preferences:

- **Implement a mechanism to remember users' cookie preferences**. This way, users won't have to set their preferences every time they visit the site, providing a smoother and more convenient experience.

#### Second example : Account deletion / Unsubscribe from newsletter

Deleting an account on any website or unsubscribe from newsletter may require several clicks to confirm the action. The various windows include descriptions intended to make you reconsider your decision and potentially change your mind.

Moreover, the delete/unsubscribe button is often hidden among other text and information, making it harder to detect.

Some platforms also offer the option to delay the deletion process. Sometimes, you can also be asked to justify your action, adding some more confusing clicks to achieve your goal. This may annoy the user and make them click the wrong button, making him even more willing to delete their account. 

- **Streamlined Deletion Process**:
Minimize the number of clicks required to delete an account or unsubscribe. A straightforward process reduces user frustration and promotes a positive experience.

- **Clear and Direct Language**:
Use clear and direct language in the deletion confirmation messages. Avoid employing tactics that may seem manipulative or designed to make users feel regret.

- **Respect User Decisions**:
Respect the user's decision. While it's reasonable to inform them about the consequences, avoid excessive warnings or descriptions that could be perceived as discouragement.

- **Efficient Security Verification**:
If security verification is necessary, make the process efficient and user-friendly. Use modern authentication methods that prioritize both security and convenience.

- **Optional User Feedback**:
Allow users to provide feedback on their decision. This not only provides valuable insights for improving user experience but also gives users a sense of agency in the process. As mentionned, this step must remain *optional*

- **Provide Clear Consequences**:
Clearly outline the consequences of deleting the account, but do so in a way that is informative rather than manipulative. Users appreciate transparency, and knowing the implications can help them make informed decisions.

- **Responsive Design**:
Ensure that the account deletion process is optimized for various devices. A responsive design contributes to a smoother experience, regardless of whether users are on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
