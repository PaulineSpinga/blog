In the article ["The Computer for the 21st Century"](https://www.lri.fr/~mbl/Stanford/CS477/papers/Weiser-SciAm.pdf) written by Mark Weiser, the concept of ubiquitous computing, or "calm technology," was introduced. Weiser's vision was to create a world where computers seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, becoming nearly invisible and unobtrusive. In many ways, some aspects of ubiquitous computing have already become a reality, while others remain aspirational.

**What Has Already Happened in Ubiquitous Computing:**

1. **Proliferation of Smart Devices:** The widespread adoption of smartphones, wearables, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices has made computing omnipresent in our lives. These devices serve as conduits for accessing information and services anywhere, anytime.

2. **Connectivity and Networking:** The development of high-speed internet and wireless networks has laid the foundation for ubiquitous computing. This connectivity enables seamless data sharing and communication across devices and platforms.

3. **Voice Assistants and AI:** Voice-activated digital assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa have become an integral part of many households, offering natural language interfaces that integrate with various devices and services.

4. **Cloud Computing:** Cloud technology has made it possible to store and access data from anywhere, reducing the dependence on a single device for data storage and retrieval.

**What Needs to Happen for Further Progress in Ubiquitous Computing:**

1. **Interoperability:** For ubiquitous computing to fully realize its potential, there must be greater interoperability among devices and systems. Devices from different manufacturers and ecosystems need to seamlessly communicate and share data.

2. **Privacy and Security:** As computing becomes more ubiquitous, it's crucial to address the privacy and security concerns associated with the constant collection and sharing of data. Robust encryption, data protection regulations, and user control over data are essential.

3. **Standardization:** The development of industry standards and protocols is vital to ensure that different devices and systems can work together smoothly. This standardization can accelerate the adoption of ubiquitous computing.

4. **Energy Efficiency:** Ubiquitous computing relies on devices that are always on and connected. To make this sustainable, there needs to be progress in energy-efficient hardware and power sources to reduce the environmental impact.

5. **User Acceptance and Training:** Widespread adoption of ubiquitous computing will require user acceptance and education. People need to understand how to use these technologies effectively and be comfortable with their presence in daily life.

6. **Ethical Considerations:** As computing becomes even more integrated into our lives, ethical considerations about its impact on society, job displacement, and individual well-being need to be addressed.

In summary, we are already living in a world of ubiquitous computing to some extent, with the proliferation of smart devices, connectivity, and AI. However, to fully realize the vision laid out by Mark Weiser, further advancements are required in terms of interoperability, privacy, standardization, energy efficiency, user education, and ethical considerations. The path toward ubiquitous computing is one of ongoing technological development and societal adaptation.
