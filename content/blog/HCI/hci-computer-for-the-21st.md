In the article ["The Computer for the 21st Century"](https://www.lri.fr/~mbl/Stanford/CS477/papers/Weiser-SciAm.pdf) written by Mark Weiser, the concept of ubiquitous computing, or "calm technology," was introduced. Weiser's vision was to create a world where computers seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, becoming nearly invisible and unobtrusive. In many ways, some aspects of ubiquitous computing have already become a reality, while others remain aspirational.


**What Has Already Happened in Ubiquitous Computing:**

1. **Proliferation of Smart Devices:** The widespread adoption of smartphones, wearables, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices has made computing omnipresent in our lives. These devices serve as conduits for accessing information and services anywhere, anytime. Indeed, we've made significant progress with the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT). The text mentions, "Coming back to her office, Sal picks up a tab and 'waves' it to her friend Joe in the design group, with whom she is sharing a virtual office." This is a clear example of interconnected devices. Smart homes, wearable devices, and sensor networks represent other manifestations of this progress.

2. **Connectivity and Networking:** The development of wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi/high-speed internet and cellular networks, enables us to stay connected wherever we go and has laid the foundation for ubiquitous computing. The text states, "Small wireless networks, based on digital cellular telephone principles, currently offer data rates between two and 10 megabits per second." These wireless networks are a precursor to ubiquitous connectivity. This connectivity enables seamless data sharing and communication across devices and platforms.

3. **Displays and Processing Power**: Advances in display technologies and processing power are essential for the development of small, mobile devices. The text mentions, "A single kind of network connection that can somehow serve all three functions has yet to be invented." It implies the need for more compact and powerful devices to achieve ubiquitous computing.

4. **Cloud Computing:** Cloud technology has made it possible to store and access data from anywhere, reducing the dependence on a single device for data storage and retrieval. This technology plays a crucial role in ubiquitous computing, allowing users to access their information seamlessly across various devices and locations.

In the context of what has already happened in ubiquitous computing, we see the proliferation of smart devices, advancements in connectivity, displays, processing power, and the widespread adoption of cloud computing. These are the building blocks that have brought us closer to the vision of a world filled with invisible widgets, where information and services are readily available from various devices in different locations.

While we have made significant strides towards ubiquitous computing, we cannot yet claim to be living in a fully realized world of ubiquitous computing as envisioned in the text. Many of the foundational technologies and concepts mentioned, such as smart devices, connectivity, and cloud computing, have become integral parts of our lives. However, the true vision of ubiquitous computing, where computers seamlessly blend into the environment and enhance our everyday interactions, is not fully realized.

In the text, we see examples of interconnected devices and an environment where computing is seamlessly integrated into daily life. For instance, the text mentions tabs, pads, and boards that facilitate various functions and interactions. However, these are still experimental concepts and not yet fully pervasive in our daily lives.

Additionally, issues related to privacy, security, and the need for further developments in network protocols and communication standards must be addressed for ubiquitous computing to become a reality.

In conclusion, while we have made substantial progress and are moving closer to the world of ubiquitous computing, we are not yet living in it. Further advancements and the widespread adoption of these technologies are needed to fully realize the vision presented in the text.

**What Needs to Happen for Further Progress in Ubiquitous Computing:**

1. **Improved Privacy and Security Measures:** As the text raises concerns about privacy and data security in a world filled with interconnected devices, there is a need for the development and implementation of robust cryptographic techniques. These techniques should ensure that private data remains confidential and that individuals have control over their personal information. The text mentions, "Fortunately, cryptographic techniques already exist to secure messages from one ubiquitous computer to another and to safeguard private information stored in networked systems." However, the widespread adoption of these techniques is crucial to mitigate privacy risks. As computing becomes more ubiquitous, it's crucial to address the privacy and security concerns associated with the constant collection and sharing of data. Robust encryption, data protection regulations, and user control over data are essential.

2. **Network Integration:** The seamless integration of wired and wireless networks is an unsolved problem. Engineers need to develop communication protocols that accommodate machines that move in physical space. The text notes, "On the other hand, the transparent linking of wired and wireless networks is an unsolved problem." To achieve a truly ubiquitous computing environment, a more comprehensive solution to network integration is required.

3. **Increased Affordability and Accessibility:** While the text mentions the potential for powerful yet lightweight devices, making such technology affordable and accessible to a wide range of users is crucial. As technology advances, ensuring that these innovations are available to a broad and diverse demographic is a significant challenge.

4. **Ethical and Privacy Concerns:** With the rise of ubiquitous computing, ethical considerations become more critical. The text alludes to potential privacy issues and the need to strike a balance between convenience and personal privacy. Solutions like "digital pseudonyms" may need to be developed to protect personal information while still enabling seamless interactions.

5. **Societal and Behavioral Shifts:** Ubiquitous computing may require shifts in societal behavior and norms, as individuals become more aware of the people on the other ends of their computer links. The text suggests that these shifts may bring communities closer together and alleviate the negative consequences of isolation brought on by conventional personal computers. 

In summary, we are already living in a world of ubiquitous computing to some extent, with the proliferation of smart devices, connectivity, and AI. However, to fully realize the vision laid out by Mark Weiser, further advancements are required. The path toward ubiquitous computing is one of ongoing technological development and societal adaptation. While the foundation has been laid, the full realization of this vision will require concerted efforts from both the technology industry and society at large.
