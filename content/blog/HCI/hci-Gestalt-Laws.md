Today's article is about **Gestalt Laws**.

* Gestalt laws, principles, or theories are psychological concepts that describe how humans perceive and make sense of visual information. 
* The term "Gestalt" comes from the German word meaning "shape" or "form," and these principles were developed by a group of German psychologists in the early 20th century. 
* The Gestalt laws highlight the ways in which people tend to organize visual elements into groups or unified wholes. 

**Here are some key Gestalt principles tackled in class**

- **Law of proximity** : things that are close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart.
- **Law of Similarity** : when things appear to be similar to each other, we group 
them together and we also tend to think they have the same function.
- **Law of Common-region**: This law is highly related to proximity. It states that when objects are located within the same closed region, we perceive them as being 
grouped together. 
- **The law of closure** : when we look at a complex arrangement of visual elements, we tend to look for a single, recognizable pattern.
- **The law of figure-ground** : people instinctively perceive objects as either being in the foreground or the background. As a human, you can focus on either the foreground or the background.

- **Law of continuity** : elements that are arranged on a line or curve are perceived to be more related than elements not on the line or curve.

#### First example: **Google Maps**

Google Maps has become a necessity for individuals who have shifted to a new city or for those who love to travel. Google Maps also adheres to the **rule of continuity**. When we set a destination on Google Maps, it displays the pathway from the starting point to the destination, and we follow that pathway to reach our destination.

However, it is sometimes not as user-friendly as desired. Indeed, the map and arrow that indicate the path to follow aren't always oriented in the same direction as the user. When moving straight, you may observe your arrow pointing backward, creating confusion about whether you are still following the correct direction.

Google should be able to provide tips to users (synchronized oral and written instructions, colors, moving icons) on correctly orienting their phones to obtain the intended sense of use.

Other ideas could be : 

- **AR guidance**: 
Integrate augmented reality features that guide users in real-time. For instance, the camera could overlay directional indicators or arrows on the live view, providing a more immersive and intuitive navigation experience.

- **Sensory Feedback**:
Explore the use of sensory feedback, such as haptic vibrations, to provide users with tactile confirmation when they correctly orient their phones. This multisensory approach can enhance the overall user experience.

#### Second example : **Closure in road sign**

In general, closure allows us to perceive incomplete shapes as complete, filling in the gaps in visual information.

It is particularly the case of road sign in which colors and shapes allow us to determine the meaning of the sign. Due to poor design, if some parts of the sign are missing or disjointed, drivers might misinterpret the incomplete shape, leading to confusion and potential safety issues. One example could be confusing the right of way and a priority road, but as we can observe in the image below, all triangular signs can be confused.

To correct it, here are some ideas : 

- Include text in panels that are similar
- Add lights or borders around shapes that might fade
- Draw the sign on the road
- Add audible alarm
